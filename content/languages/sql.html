Floating-Point Types
--------
The SQL standard defines three binary floating-point types:

* `REAL` has implementation-dependent precision (usually maps to a hardware-supported type like IEEE 754 single or double precision)
* `DOUBLE PRECISION` has implementation-dependent precision which is greater than `REAL` (usually maps to IEEE 754 double precision)
* `FLOAT(N)` has at least `N` binary digits of precision, with an implementation-dependent maximum for `N`

The exponent range for all three types is implementation-dependent as well.

Decimal Types
-------------
The standard defines two fixed-point decimal types:

* `NUMERIC(M,N)` has exactly `M` total digits, `N` of them after the decimal point
* `DECIMAL(M,N)` is the same as `NUMERIC(M,N)`, except that it is allowed to have more than `M` total digits

The maximum values of `M` and `N` are implementation-dependent. Vendors often implement the two types identically.

How to Round
------------

The SQL standard defines no explicit rounding, but most vendors provide a `ROUND()` or `TRUNC()` function.

However, it usually makes little sense to round within the database, since its job is *storing* data, while rounding is an aspect of *displaying* data, and should therefore be done by the code in the presentation layer.
